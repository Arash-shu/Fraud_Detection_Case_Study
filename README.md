This is the last case study at Galvanize which lasted for two days. My partner and I completed and accomplished all steps by an exception of AWS part. After two days, the work was presented for the duration of 10 minutes.

Please note that the data are not shareable. In addition, one python file (80 lines of code for incoming live predictions) is not attached due to security reasons.

# Fraud Detection Case Study

For the next two days we will work with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study.  We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together.

Topics included in this case study include:
* Classification modeling.
* Programming Practice: Handing off models. 
* Teamwork.
* Web applications.
* Website hosting with AWS
* Deploying a DS application.
* Data visualization.
* Results presentation.

#### Rough timeline 

* Day 1: Project scoping, Team direction, Model building
* Day 2: Web app and deployment

#### Deliverables

We will want two deliverables from you for this project:

* A dashboard for investigators to use which helps them identify new events that are worthy of investigation for fraud.  This will pull in new data regularly, and update a useful display for the investigation team.  How you wish to lay this out is up to you.
* A ten-minute presentation on your process and results. 

#### Notes

* Notes has been removed.
